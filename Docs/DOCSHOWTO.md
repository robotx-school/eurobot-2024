# How To Write Docs
This is a simple instruction of how to write docs for code in this repository
## Basics
All docs stored in `/Docs/` directory. In `/Docs/README.md` you can find a table of documentations with links.

Every documentation starts with header(like header in this document). Markdown for header:
```

</p>

# Title here
```
After header you can write documentation content. You can learn some markdown basics [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Docs review
Documentation is a very important part of the project, so we need to be sure of its quality. Therefore, after writing the documentation file, please send the issue with a request to check the documentation. Or send a pull request instead of pushing directly.
